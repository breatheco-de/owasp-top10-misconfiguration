### **Log in to bWAPP**

1. Start the BeeBox virtual machine.
2. Access the bWAPP web interface from your browser using the IP address of the BeeBox machine.
3. **Log in to bWAPP**:

    ```bash

    ```

4. **Select OWASP Top 10**. In the bWAPP menu, choose "OWASP Top 10" from the dropdown list to view the available vulnerabilities.
5. Explore the different OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities listed in bWAPP and select **Remote & Local File Inclusion (RFI/LFI)** for the guided activity and click "Hack".

> âš  You might find **Remote & Local File Inclusion (RFI/LFI)** listed under Missing Functional Level Access Control because the Remote & Local File Inclusion (RFI/LFI) vulnerability can appear in multiple security categories depending on the context in which it is analyzed. Although it is more commonly classified under Security Misconfiguration, in some cases, it may be listed under categories like Missing Function Level Access Control, as bWAPP has done.
