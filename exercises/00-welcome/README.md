## ðŸ’¬ Understanding Local File Inclusion (LFI)

Local File Inclusion (LFI) is a significant security vulnerability that can arise from improper configuration or coding practices in web applications. It allows an attacker to include files from the local server, potentially accessing sensitive information or executing unintended commands. Hereâ€™s why understanding and mitigating LFI is crucial:

- **Access to Sensitive Information:** LFI can expose sensitive files on the server, such as configuration files or user data, which can be leveraged for further attacks.
- **Insecure Configuration:** Misconfigured file paths or inadequate input validation can make an application vulnerable to LFI, demonstrating the need for proper security measures and coding practices.
- **Impact on Server Security:** LFI can compromise the security of the server by exposing internal files or allowing unauthorized access to critical resources.
