## üìù Instructions

In this activity, we will use the BeeBox virtual machine, which contains the vulnerable application bWAPP, to explore and exploit vulnerabilities included in the [OWASP Top 10](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/). We will focus on the **Security Misconfiguration (A05:2021)** vulnerability, demonstrating how **Local File Inclusion (LFI)** can be exploited in this context.

**Local File Inclusion (LFI)**

Through this exploitation, we will demonstrate how incorrect configuration can allow an attacker to access sensitive local files on the server, revealing confidential information.
